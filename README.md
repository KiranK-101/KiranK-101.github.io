2. I have a new GitHub account since I have never used it before. I have learned it is a central repository for storing and sharing code related to my academic and personal projects.
3. The repository I created is for "Lesson 5: GitHub Lab." It is currently empty, but it will contain all the necessary files in future projects, including source code, documentation, and any supporting materials.
4. I followed the assignment steps closely to clone the repository onto my local machine. First, I navigated to the repository page on GitHub and clicked on the "Code" button. I then copied the repository URL. I opened the terminal on my local machine and navigated to the folder where I wanted to store the repository. Then, I clicked "clone repository," and that was it.

# About _**Me**_
## Interests/Hobbies
I've played golf and did tournaments since I was very young, and I've also practiced a traditional Indian dance called Bhangra my whole life. Other than that I enjoy music as much as the next person, singing (like karaoke with my friends), reading webcomics, and I watch a lot of shows, movies, anime, etc. basically anything.
## Websites I Recommend
  - [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) - I love Canva because it is a project design site that allows you to create a **unique** design for whatever you need and in many different formats. Even if you lack creativity, there are hundreds of unique templates to choose from!
  - [Microsoft - Math Solver](https://mathsolver.microsoft.com/en) - This site is super useful because you can solve algebra, calculus, trigonometry and other math problems with detailed _step-by-step_ explanations.
